I’m @MatteoCherubini, graduated in Computer Science in Florence in the Academic Year 2020/2021 with a thesis on PWA.

I have general interests and knowledge regarding Music, Video and Photography.

My intentions for the future are aimed at the profession of Developer Advocate: I'm a good teacher and I always keep up to date on new technologies.

I’m currently using Node.js, Vue.js, Bun, Ionic, Firebase to develop Progressive Web Applications and Obsidian to keep me productive.
