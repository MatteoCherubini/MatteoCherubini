Hi, I am @MatteoCherubini, a Computer Science graduate from Florence in the 2020/2021 academic year with a thesis on Progressive Web Apps.

I spent a few months of 2022 in America studying, with excellent results, in an incredible college course in Indianapolis called the [Program for Intensive English](https://liberalarts.iupui.edu/programs/inpie/our-program/study-english-at-pie/) (PIE), in which I met students from literally all over the world and discovered that I was not so antisocial after all.

I have interest regarding Recording and Production, Video Content Creation and Photography.

Professionally, as reflected in my [Thesis](https://github.com/MatteoCherubini/text-editor-pwa/blob/master/presentazioneCherubini4.pdf), I am interested in how Users approach modern Operating Systems, including modern Web Browsers.

My intentions for the future are towards the profession of Developer Advocate, a profession in which one Experiments, Studies and Teaches. Which fits me like a glove.

I am also passionate about and therefore keep up to date with new Technologies.

I am currently using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) as a JavaScript runtime and am getting interested in the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) project, while as a development framework I am using [Vue.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrxmtDw4pVI&ab_channel=Honeypot) and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) for the front-end side, while [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/use-cases) for the back-end side of Progressive Web Applications.

Finally, I am getting into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), an extremely efficient notes program that I use to keep productive and up-to-date.

Overall I would describe myself as mediocre üëÄ, but at my best üëç.
